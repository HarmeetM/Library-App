# Library-App
Using concepts such as CSS Grid, Javascript objects, DOM Manipulation, as well as soon introducing prototypes + looping through array to display HTML on page. A simple library app that allows you to add books to the library, as well as remove. There is no storage solutions implemented for it yet, nor is the form validation complete yet. Will revisit soon to complete.
